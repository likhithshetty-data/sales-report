In this task, I explored and visualized the superstore sales dataset using power BI. My objective was to transform raw data into insightful visual stories that can support better business decision-making. i created multiple visuals:
sales and profit by region to identify geographical performace
sum of sales my order name
Top 10 products by profit to highlight high-performing items
sum of sales by category to uncover product-level trends

I designed each chart with a focus on clarity, relevance and minimal clutter.
